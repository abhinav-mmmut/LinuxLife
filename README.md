# LinuxLife-backend
This is a springboot based backend to a fullstack project that I call LinuxLife. This is for all the linux lovers who enjoy everything about linux, 
be it the freedom to do anything ans everything with only a few keyboard commands or the ability to customize each and every element to your liking.

The frontend of this project is here: https://github.com/abhinav-mmmut/LinuxLife-frontend

The backend boasts of a secure environment with JWT for authentication and authorization. There is form login to allow the users to register, login and interact with the app.
There are a few public pages while others are secure and will only be accesible upon authentication.

public end points:
[POST] /api/auth/signup
[POST] /api/auth/login
[GET] /api/posts/all

secure end points:
[POST] api/posts/
[POST] /api/posts/update
[DELETE] /api/posts/delete
